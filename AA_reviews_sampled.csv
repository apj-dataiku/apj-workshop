0,I bought first class tix from Tampa to Providence RI (connect ia DCA).  Weather & mechanical probs on both flights (no prob- it happens).  However our connecting flight had no first class available (again no prob - lets just get there).  So i ask for a refund on the non first class portion of the flights.  First is $400 and economy is $200.  I get $58 back. No explanation no one to contact.  I'll avoid AA in future.
1,"We booked our vacation through Sandals, including airline tickets. Our flight was supposed to leave at 6am and we had an hour and a half for the connecting flight. Our flight was delayed and therefore we would miss our connection. The next flight was 18 hours later, not happy. So we did not get to spend our first night at the resort. On top of that our return flight was delayed 1 1/2 hours. I would rather walk than us American Airlines again"
2,"They were sending me to the wrong city. It was completely their mistake. However, since I didn't realize until my layover, they would do nothing to fix it. Tried to charge me $1000 for new tickets to fix their mistake. They said I should've caught their mistake and since I didn't, (at 5am), it was my fault. I will never fly American again. Also, no decent inflight services. Basically, they are always a disappointment. This time they outdid themselves with their extreme levels of incompetence, apathy, and uselessness."
3,"I paid over $200 for Main cabin plus because I am 6 months pregnant & incredibly uncomfortable.  For all four of my flights to and from Boston, I was told they gave my reserved seats away & that I would be reimbursed.After weeks of emails ( they have nobody to contact by phone), they told me sorry but seats aren‚Äôt guaranteed.The ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to Main cabin plus was a complete scam.  I was crammed in a middle seat in the back of the plane, while having to get up and bother my neighbors for frequent bathrooms breaks & leg movement.  On our flights from Boston to Maui there was no food given or available for purchase (both over 6 hour flights).  NO free entertainment or option to purchase wifi.Total Scam."
4,"I wish that it was possible to rate American Airlines Customer Service less than one star.   This past summer in Europe was the worst experience of my wife and myself flying anywhere in the world.   American Airlines Customer Service could not have been less interested in remediating our covid-caused flight changes.   The AA ""Customer Service"" seems to exist only to be able to tell customers that they are not going to do anything for the customer.   They must be trained in the fine art of saying ""No"" while repeating the mantra that they are ""Customer Service"" and really care about you as a customer."
5,"they cancelled our flight at 11.25pm 10 hours before our flight, already at Heathrow airport. 4 months on despite promises of compensation nothing has been received - they ruined my moms 70th Birthday and couldn't care less. I've had confirmation all forms received for compensation 2 weeks ago but still nothing, they don't care- not replied to messages and replied to some without actually reading the message. disgraceful....."
6,Me and wife are newlyweds. We're traveling on American to our destination when changed our seating arrangement.. we had assigned seats ridiculous.. had to ask to sit next to my wife.. crazy business totally unprofessional of a company.. Also had assigned seat coming back same thing terrible company unacceptable..
7,"Wish I could give zero stars. Bottom line:  AAL simply does not care about passengers. I am canceling all future AAL flights, canceling my American Advantage membership and writing a complete review to The US Department of Transportation. AAL needs to be sold to a competent airline operator or fined out of existence."
8,"American Airlines honestly was disappointing, to say the least. I previously put them in a higher tier than many other airlines, but they proved me wrong. My wife and I were delayed an hour during an already very long international flight from Fl to PA and then to Ireland. Because of the flight being delayed, we almost missed our international flight (we barely made it, we were the last ones on the plane), and to make it worse, the flight attendants said they couldn't even serve snacks or refreshments (we paid extra for alcoholic drinks). Then on the way home, we paid extra for all-day internet, and it did not work at all. To be fair, the stewards were very apologetic in these scenarios and very nice, but unfortunately, this does not make up the money we spent on extra conveniences which were not received. My wife tried calling the airline to see if they could offer some compensation for the money we spent, but not only was the customer service not helpful they said they needed us to write an email basically explaining the same information, which to me seemed very redundant and ultimately defeats the purpose of having customer service hotlines. Finally, they responded a few days later, basically stating that we got to sit on the seats we purchased and that essentially nothing is guaranteed, even if we paid to receive extra services."
9,"I booked a flight via their website, but they didn‚Äòt accept my german VISA credit card. So I was passed on the german website of American Airlines, booked it there and received a booking confirmation. Then, at the airport check-in they said that my flight is not paid yet even though I saw the blocked charge in my credit card account. I offered to pay once again at the check-in, but was not possible they said and I had to book a whole new flight. Price was twice as much then!! What an effrontery! Be careful in case you don‚Äòt book via the .com website of American Airlines! That‚Äòs a rip off!"
10,They are the worst company to deal with during the recent storm we were cancelled due to the airport being closed they put us on a flight the next day but that was cancelled as well our only option was fly from Miami on the Thursday as mco was still closed they would not pay or help with the cost incurred to get us there no help what‚Äôs so ever the food on the plane was inedible DONT USE THEM
11,"Flight cancelled, sent us to a destination that made it impossible to catch their transfer flight, no more flights till tomorrow, they refuse to pay for a hotel..."
12,"Pack some food, you may not get any, even on very long transcontinental flights. When contacted AA explained that food isn‚Äôt guaranteed‚Ä¶ no apologies."
13,"Trice and Charnette from American Airlines Chicago O‚Äôhare Airport customer service were the BEST!!! Trice helped me with my flight, my stay, made me feel like a special customer!! Thank you girls!!üòçüòç (ps: there was a total a.hole didn‚Äôt want to help at first. So look for a friendly face!!)"
14,"Many years loyalty with AA and they don't  care. Stranded at the airports several times because they over sold and lied that there were no other flights out... i was booked early. However, I was found out later their were several flights available. Recently, experience that they kick me out of the selected seat have confirmed, to the back of rear airplane. This is what they said they care about the elite members. Call AA is not able to resolved it. I hope they need to improve their service and care about their elite members, by be fair and trustworthy."
15,We flew AA from Detroit to Chicago where we were supposed to catch a flight to Los Angeles. In Los Angeles we would board a cruise ship. When we landed we were told our flight had been delayed due to mechanical issues. Ticket agents tried to find a flight that would get us to LA. Boarding was at 1:00. There were no flights available. So we missed our cruise!AA gave us six meal vouchers. None of them worked. They put us in a hotel. No luggage. We got up early the next day to catch a flight back to Detroit. This flight was pushed back again and again. I contacted AA. They offered us 2500 air lines as compensation for a $2300 cruise. I contacted them again. They gave us $350 credit each. I tried again and they added another $200 credit each. This is NOT acceptable compensation. AA should reimburse me the price of the cruise!
16,It is damn near IMPOSSIBLE to get a complimentary upgrade on AA.I am a LIFETIME GOLD MEMBER and have flown just under 2 MILLION MILES as a customer since 1990.I alway request the upgrade when making reservation...NEVER score the upgrade.
17,AA has lots of issues but still better than most other options. Way better than United imo.
18,I had a flight cancelled on the day of flying and had to sort out alternative flight with them. They were not very helpful and the delay was over 4 hours. i complained and so far they have taken until now to rspond. they offered ¬£260 compensation which I understand is half of the standard amount and still having problems with no response. Anybody got any ideas
19,"Please do not fall for their marketing ""value of tickets never expire and you can make unlimited changes"". I found out my tickets expired in July this year when medical issue prevented me from using the ticket.  Do better, American Airlines. Taking my hard earned money and taking advantage. My choice will be to take my business somewhere else."
20,"American airlines is the absolute worst! In the last three trips I've taken, twice I was unable to get a wheelchair and had to walk, and put myself out horribly, in order to get to my gate, and now I'm sitting waiting for a flight with two other people I was supposed to be traveling with, and after spending over an hour on the phone 2 weeks ago, I found out our seats were never properly assigned and nothing that was requested was ever done. They have the absolute most horrible customer service of any airline I have had to deal with.  Then, they tell me it's my fault because I didn't double check to make sure I had seats even though I was told that I did. They are nasty, rude b****** and never want deal with American again. They can't even be nice about it. Amazing how people could not do their jobs, be rude to people, and do everything wrong, and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about it. They don't have a problem, they don't lose their jobs, they're not uncomfortable, they're not the ones that can't walk for 2 days after traveling, they couldn't care less. Save yourself! Do not use this airline"
21,"Trice and Charnette from American Airlines Chicago O‚Äôhare Airport customer service were the BEST!!! Trice helped me with my flight, my stay, made me feel like a special customer!!

22,"Our experience on a flight from Nashville TN to Frankfurt Germany has been awful. We did this same route 10 days ago leaving Germany and it wasn't nearly as difficult or upsetting, but honestly both trips had me in tears at parts of them.Most of my grievances are specifically with the Charlotte/Douglas Airport American Airlines employees. The outward bound trip had almost a 3 hour delay getting on our connection flight from there to Nashville... this was after the first long leg flight from Germany to Charlotte, so we already had a 3 hour layover as we had to customs in NC and collect our bag and bring it for drop off to our connection flight to Nashville. After doing all that we end up being delayed almost 3 hours (so 6 hours total at this Airport).... we could have rented a car and drove to Nashville in that timeframe which we would have preferred honestly because then maybe our toddler would have gotten some sleep. Once we finally made it to Nashville the baggage crew had us waiting almost an hour for our bags. Now coming back to Germany trip is where it gets worse.... Nashville flight to Charlotte everything was fine with exception the plane we had this time had like micro storage above that no one could fit their carry on bags which caused a lot of bag drop off and pick up at flight gate and of course our travel stroller is the last item that comes out getting off that flight in Charlotte NC to transfer to our connection to Frankfurt Germany.At that gate (D9 specifically) in Charlotte NC is where I was having to deal with the very rude woman at the gate and that's where I'm positive I also ended up leaving behind my brand new jacket while I was being rudely talked down to and ultimately had to just walk away to avoid further confrontation with this American Airlines employee. This all started with boarding the gate when the woman employee requested I fold down my stroller, so she could check its size in the metal carry on baggage thing they have near gate. Ok no problem I'm confident we will not have an issue as it's the same plane we took coming here and I know the travel stroller fits in the overhead with no issues (Joolz Aer -specifically super lightweight and compact for airplane travel). My husband and child continue boarding as we have a carseat to install and need the time to do this, so I'm standing there with my stroller on the measuring thing and it fits perfectly when she started telling me NO it's too big and comes right on the max line for size and demanding I bag and tag it. I question her on this and said it was no issue coming here and fit fine to which I'm told, ""I don't care what they let you do on that flight you're not allowed to bring that stroller as a carry on because I say it wont fit and I just told some first class couple the same too about their stroller, so if they can't bring it neither are you!"".... OK wow, so I tell her my husband has the travel bag in the carry on suitcase and I need to leave and get on the plane to get it from him and I'll be right back then to which I'm getting all this attitude from her and she began saying things like well that's not my problem I didn't tell him could go ahead and board... blah blah blah. I quickly board and get the travel bag from my husband and run back out to the gate entrance to bag and tag the stroller. While doing this I sit down my jacket close by and then become rushed by an different attendant about tagging the bag. I ask her to give me a minute while I bag it and she sticks on the tag and hands me my receipt and tells me to bring it the gate drop off where I saw someone else leave their stroller near plane entrance. I pick it up and turn to grab by jacket when I'm suddenly screamed at my the original rude attendant to drop it now and do not carry it anywhere or we're going to have a problem... ok WOW. Really...is she for real saying this to me and no one blinks an eye!? At this point I want to explode on this woman as she is really pushing me, but because I did not want to escalate an already tense situation I sat down my stroller and walked away back onto the plane. Only at take off do I realize I walked off without my jacket and I'm sure I will never see it again with that woman working the boarding desk. No one on flight was willing to help either with contacting the desk and at least putting my mind as ease about my jacket, so now I'm on a long haul flight paying $30 to use their slow internet to try and submit an online lost and found ticket and writing this review while it's still fresh in my head."

25,"Flying from UK to Hawaii. American Airlines changed our flight without informing us. Luckily we noticed in the week before. This change meant we would arrive in Honolulu two hours later, therefore missing our connecting flight to Maui where our hotel and hire car arrived. This was the last flight of the night, therefore we had to sleep in the airport and miss a night in an expensive hotel we'd already paid for. We called American airlines to try and find a solution, they just kept offering us flight's that got us there even later!! They offered a ¬£50 credit to use on American Airlines which we'll never get to use and doesn't help with the financial losses suffered.Terrible!Plus, no food whatsoever or blankets on the 5.5 hour flight from LA to hawaii ! Freezing and hungry"
26,My 20 year old daughter flew out of Heathrow to Chicago with American airlines (AA) on Oct 23rd. She was also booked on a connecting flight with AA to Buffalo that same day. Unfortunately the original AA flight to Chicago was diverted to Iceland because of a medical emergency. This delay meant she missed her connection. My daughter booked both flights through British Airways (BA). At Chicago passengers were told that AA would sort out any missed connecting flight.  They refused to help my daughter as her flights had been booked through BA. There was no-one at Chicago from BA either to help her. She had to book a new flight at a cost of $330  to get her to Buffalo.  We thought ut would be easy to get a refund for the missed flight- big error on our part. AA are refusing to refund her as they say it's BA fault. BA are refusing to refund her as they say its AA fault. Both companies have been shocking and should both be ashamed of how they have treated a young girl and left her out of pocket.
27,"We were supposed to go on a trip in July but due to circumstances were unable. In July, American Airlines said that we had until the end of the year to make a new reservation. Fast forward to yesterday and I spoke with a supervisor. I gave him the new dates to travel and after almost an hour on the phone he said it was all taken care of and because the new tickets were less than our originals we wouldn't have to pay anything. He said he would email a confirmation email after the call. The email never came, so I called today. They had no record of my call from yesterday and there was nothing in their system that said I had any flights booked and there was zero notation about my previous call. After an hour on the phone they finally got the flight booked except it was going to cost almost $900. I couldn't pay that so they said they could redo all the tickets in economy, so after another hour on the phone they changed it and I was going to be charged... $730. Then after a half hour on the phone arguing that they should honor the price I was already told, they brought it to $334. I was trying so hard to be polite but they wouldn't budge. So, I went from paying nothing to $334 because American Airlines doesn't honor their own prices, and spending hours on the phone. Will never fly American again, and you shouldn't either."
28,"On November 5, 2022 I had a flight going to Puerto Vallarta out of Manhattan, KS (MHK) at 6:04 am which is 10 minutes from my home for my son's wedding but this flight was canceled at the last minute. I called several times to make sure the American Airlines app was an error in which it wasn‚Äôt. I had to rearrange my flight and book out of Kansas City (MCI) which is 2 ¬Ω hours away.This incident not only caused me distress, anxiety, and a major risk in the middle of the night trying to catch a flight but also additional funds lost and spent. I arrived a day late and lost $398.40, paid for additional gas $65 to get to the airport, paid for food $60 for the overnight stay and the next day travel, paid for parking $32.50, and numerous emotional breakdowns on the way caused me PTSD and swollen legs from the numerous flights and wait time. This is unacceptable and I demand compensation for the major issue American Airlines has caused. I also paid an additional ticket price for the departure and return to MHK instead of MCI for convenience.The stress of getting to my destination ruined my whole vacation. I also had to drive back home on November 9th 2022  in the middle of the night on a dark highway 2 ¬Ω hours away from home. I didn't get home till 2 am on November 10th 2022 when I could have gotten home in a matter of 10 mins if this issue didn‚Äôt occur. This situation has stressed me out, depressed me, and tainted my view of traveling and ever booking with American Airlines and I demand compensation and a response to this issue as soon as possible and not just a $50 credit."
29,Wish i could give 0 stars! They canceled last minute claimed they were sold out. I looked after and saw flights going out. Very very unhelpful.
30,I'm so upset they make these extraordinary offers and say that you're insured and that your flight will be taken care of if you need to make arrangements or need somewhere to stay they didn't do anything for me and I paid for the insurance and they didn't do anything the insurance company wouldn't even answer the phone and I had to travel during a hurricane scared and they did not care they lied on the website and said that the flight could be changed for free but when I went to have help to get it changed no one would help me do not waste your money time or efforts on this airline you will regret it I know I sure did being stuck in another state and not knowing what's going on and you buy insurance so that if something does happen you're good and then you're not good that insurance is it worth the paper that it was printed on so save your money and your time and try a different airline
31,Normally I expect to be treated like trash flying economy but I was flying first class round trip and I was shocked at the service. When you fly first class with AA you get no greeting or hello. A racist look up and down making sure you didn‚Äôt upgrade yourself just grabbing a seat from economy. You also get an attitude and a bag of peanuts and one drink. Flight attendants act like they are doing you a favor and can‚Äôt be bothered to provide service.Also there is no lounge access for first class flyers unless flying international. Oh and they overcharged for my upgrade. One upgrade said there would be free alcoholic beverages we received nothing. Never flying AA again. Lesson learned.
32,"I hope this reaches the masses. This airlines strives for your loyalty. The propaganda they present about all the perks and rewards are superficial. Please do not be drawn into their words and advertisements. The fact that they strive for your loyalty but show ZERO loyalty back to you when needed is prevalent at the most in opportune time. I was a big advocate for this airlines being that I fly between 3-5 times a month. The perks for being a loyalty member were ok at best. The more you ride the train the more you see that loyalty is just a number. When you ask of them in a time of need, they will not be there. All you are is a number when it comes to their customer service. I booked a flight 5 months in advance. Their policy is within 24 hrs of booking you can cancel for a refund. I cancelled within 48 hrs and all they would be willing to do is give me a flight credit of the amount spent ($2500). They do not budge and the lack of loyalty in return is magnified. Spare yourself the stress and find a more customer orientated airlines to be loyal too. Let me add that you cannot talk to someone physically over the phone in their customer relations department. You‚Äôre Left with submitting a form and waiting for their response which is 7 business days."
33,Thought I would give ‚Äò‚Äòem another try. Too reminiscent of the US Air days to use them again. Back to Delta. FYI their customer service is terrible.
34,"I had a flight scheduled through this Airline from Indianapolis to Dallas and Dallas to Seattle. Instead it took me to Phoenix instead. Second issue is they did not do preventative checks and maintenance between flights from wherever they came from to Indianapolis and from there to Phoenix. Our flight got delayed causing me to miss my flight to Seattle. I was on government orders by the military and needed to get to Seattle to switch airlines and get to my overseas destination. Customer service at Phoenix sucks and they told me my baggage somehow made it to the Seattle flight as I was told that night. When I got to the airport next morning, I found out that the luggage was still at Phoenix. My next problem was due to trying to make it on time to my government purchased flight, I asked what is the earliest time I could get to Seattle they said 0830 and I thought she said morning. Woke up next day and looked and my boarding pass said pm. When I need to be at Seattle by AM. I had very little time left to get to Seattle now and booked on another airline to hopefully make the next flight on time after getting luggage and then recheck it but now instead after the purchase on the other airline I find out my luggage is still at Phoenix and the office isn't open in time for my next flight. This is the worse airline I have experienced, traveling on Federal orders and this is how I get treated. I appreciate the vouchers however but goodness someone needs to pull their head out their butt."
35,"I fly a few times a month out of ohare and usually use united (not great either) but, American has been terrible and especially the last 4 flights I've had with them (I booked with American only because of availability and timing). Every flight I've had with them had either last day cancelations or was delayed significantly. They do not give realistic updates and tell you boarding is happening soon even if there is clearly no plane even landed yet at the gate. They habitually over book and request volunteers to move flights the day of and force the gate checking of carry on luggage because of their inferior aircraft overhead space. I'm not one for reviews but don't book american if you literally have any other option."
36,I had a flight cancelled on the day of flying and had to sort out alternative flight with them. They were not very helpful and the delay was over 4 hours. i complained and so far they have taken until now to rspond. they offered ¬£260 compensation which I understand is half of the standard amount and still having problems with no response. Anybody got any ideas
37,DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIRLINES!!!Let‚Äôs start with arriving for my flight on 11/4 that was suppose to depart at 6:59am for LGA to RDU. It never departed until 12:35pm but not before all the passengers on the full to capacity plane sat on the runway for over 2 hours before we returned to the gate and deplaned. There reasoning was due to the bad weather at RDU which was partially a lie because it was foggy there until 10am the latest. NY however was foggy. So after departing at 12:35pm and finally arriving at RDU and out the plane by 1:45pm it gets worst. Due to the above complications my return flight to LGA for 4:59pm on 11/4 had to be switched. I explained to customer service what occurred which was no fault of mine and they still made me pay a $150 to change the flight to a later time for my daughter and I. Okay so I paid it and was scheduled for the 7:30pm flight to LGA. Upon my arrival back to RDU to get on my flight which was set to depart at 7:30pm and what do you know flight delayed until 10:30pm then while still waiting flight delayed to 11:15pm then next thing I know flight cancelled. So I call customer service to find out what‚Äôs the reason and can you believe the reason is they have no crew members. They provided no hotel accommodations so my child and I was stranded in the airport and I had to basically negotiate my $150 refund back with customer service and I am still sitting in RDU waiting to board another flight to get back to NY. Mind you it is now 11/5 and oh yeah only new flight I was able to get from them was going to be at 6:59am to JFK and my car is parked at LGA where all this madness started. Despite all this I spoke to three customer service representative who were very helpful out of the 15 I spoke to over the last 24 hours of madness. The utter lack of compassion and respect for the customers is very disturbing. As a major airline they need to be more transparent on what is occurring so customers can make appropriate  decisions or alternate preparations.
38,Had miles transferred to another AA member and they said it would cost $77 which was fine. When they got to the airport AA then said I didn‚Äôt have enough miles even tho they had my seat reserved with miles and I had cancelled.
39,"I am writing this review because the experience that I have had with AmericanAirlines in the past two days is honestly unbelievable. My daughter is a minor and was flying back from Anchorage to Myrtle Beach on November 2, 2022. When she arrived at the airport for check in They sent her to the gate with the app on her cell phone for boarding. She is an unaccompanied minor which I paid extra for so you cannot use the app for boarding. That was their first mistake because by the time she went back to the desk she ended up missing her flight. Because of that she did not return to Myrtle Beach when she was supposed to. She had to be put on a flight for the next night which was extremely inconvenient especially because of her school. She then leaves Anchorage on the next flight which was the next night and when she arrives in Dallas she has no unaccompanied minor tag or chaperone. When I find this out I go straight to the Myrtle Beach airport to find out why my child is alone in Dallas. In the process she finds someone and ask about her chaperone  and she is told that she is not on a list for a chaperone. A lady sits with her anyway but tells her that she will probably not have a chaperone  when she gets to Charlotte. While I am at Myrtle Beach airport I find out that Anchorage airport put my child on the plane and did not list her as an unaccompanied minor so she was not chaperoned. I wasted my entire morning at Myrtle Beach airport trying to make sure that my child was safe and would make it back to Myrtle Beach because she still had another connecting flight. I am making this review to make anyone aware that has a minor child to possibly find another airline because this is the most unacceptable thing that I have ever had to deal with. I am extremely unhappy with this entire situation and I can say that if nothing else the one mistake that an airline should never make is not having a chaperone available for a minor that has three different flights. When booking this flight I was assured multiple times that my child would not be alone and that was not the case. Once again this whole situation has been absolutely unbelievable. I pray that no parent ever has to experience the stress that I have with this airline."
40,No customer service email address for enquiries regarding AAadvantage.
41,"Please do not fall for their marketing ""value of tickets never expire and you can make unlimited changes"". I found out my tickets expired in July this year when medical issue prevented me from using the ticket.  Do better, American Airlines. Taking my hard earned money and taking advantage. My choice will be to take my business somewhere else."
42,I am very satisfied and appreciative of the American ailines crew that assisted us on our entire journey from Honolulu to Heathrow London. ABIGAIL GRAY is her name and she had eased our  worries and stress.If all the crew is like her then i wud gladly confirm that your airline will be of a huge compliment.i am making these review to thank her so much.
43,Cannot check in onlineThe website is awful.  It wants you to download their App but you cannot if you do not have a US zip code.It would not let me select a passenger to check in. The WORST airline website ever. Even Ethiopian is better
44,"As a twelve year military veteran, I‚Äôve spent a significant amount of time on flights all over the world. In that time, I‚Äôve never felt the need to write a bad review until American Airlines. Prior to the start of the trip, we had to rebook multiple times and reschedule plans due to the airlines canceling flights and expecting us to deal with their total lack of organization via email and numerous phone calls.During our first flight home, they canceled our connecting flight three separate times. They ultimately rescheduled us for a flight that departs 25 hours later. Bear in mind, we had originally paid extra to get an early flight home and now we‚Äôre an entire day late. We spent 30 minutes attempting to locate any American Airline employees to help in the airport. We finally located the ‚ÄúAdmirals Club‚Äù (a club to supposedly help American Airlines guests) and asked for assistance switching the destination to a closer airport so we could rent a car with our own money and the guy refused to help us because we weren‚Äôt card members. Not only did he refuse to help us, but he proceeded to mock our circumstances and went as far as having the audacity to ask if we wanted to sign up for an American Airlines credit card because he would then, and only then, be able to assist us. If you want to pay thousands of dollars to be treated as if you don‚Äôt matter, American Airlines is the place for you. I‚Äôm going to happily spend the next 25 hours on every travel review website explaining just how our experience was, to hopefully advise other travelers to book elsewhere and help them avoid enduring this horrific experience. Flight Confirmation #: LDKKVA"
45,"Key West, Fantasy Fest weekend.  Trying to leave our flight is delayed 11 times,  flight #1925. AA claims it was weather related and no compensation. There are no rooms available anywhere due to 50,000 plus people hitting the small island this weekend. Looking out the window its bright clear and wonderful weather. Im confused. We were told we could take advantage of the complimentary lobby seating for our overnight stay and perhaps they could honor their travel commitments tomorrow. When I was younger the airlines were a special way to travel. Customers were treated as a valuable commodity.  Today they treat you as an inconvenience at best and with utter disdain most any other time. You are not a customer but a victim to their greed and incompetence. When a merchant sells you a product or service they either deliver or go out of business.  Not so the airlines and AA in particular.  They get propped up by banks and governments with no need to provide quality service for payment rendered.  I will drive 10,000 miles before I put my family and myself in their clutches ever again. You are nothing but cattle to America Airlines. Looking out the lobby window there is a bit of haze. Perhaps its from the crack they might be smoking at American Airlines."
46,"We spent almost 1 1/2 hours 100 ft from gate waiting to exit the plane at Baton Rouge BTR.  They said no gate was available, but I have a picture out the window showing there was an empty gate.  Pilot said there was bad weather in Dallas and that was contributing to the delay exiting in Baton Rouge.  They turned off the wifi and wouldn't turn it back on.  They could have pulled up mobile stairs and let us exit the plane that way.  If there had been an emergency on the plane, we would have all been off in 5 minutes, but they made us wait for 90 minutes!"

48,"Never fly with American Airlines; Spirit or Frontier are so much better!8th Oct 2022, I was flying Pensacola, Florida to LAX with a connection in Charlotte, North Carolina.There was a maintenance detail leaving Pensacola which caused a missed connecting flight from Charlotte to LAX.Landed in Charlotte at 9.30pm and was told the next flight to LAX would be the next morning 7.10am. The Service desk suggested as there was such a short period of time between flights I should sleep somewhere in the airport. Mind you, there are no hotels in the airport complex.Firstly, it is a ridiculous suggestion to say a passenger sleep on the floor or a seat somewhere in the airport. Someone in front of me asked for a blanket and the service desk said ""We don't have those for offer."" At that hour all the airport shops were closed so noone could purchase a blanket.The cheapest hotel I could find within a 30min drive from the airport was $140USD.It wasn't until I put in my refund request a few days later I was told the ""agreed rate"" for a hotel refund in Charlotte was $101 dollars.On top of that, I missed one night of paid accommodation in LAX. They are not offering a refund for this.Instead I've been offered a $125 paper travel voucher which will be delivered to my Australian address in 6 weeks time and a lesser than full refund for a hotel I needed due to an airline fault.I've emailed consistently and gotten responses of ""you're a valued customer"" and ""we appreciate your feedback"" but no addressing my request of full refunds for the hotel and missed LA accommodation.Its been 3 weeks of handballing, sidestepping the issue and delayed email responses. Poor behaviour American Airlines. I'll never fly with you again, a budge airline has been customer service than you."
49,The lowest of low customer service.  I broke an ankle and they refused to issue a refund or reschedule.  No sympathy whatsoever.  Just greed.  Take your money elsewhere.
